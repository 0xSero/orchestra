## Task 01

### Goal
Map fixture entry points and draft a preliminary code map for the Boomerang fixture under the target folder.

### Before
- `scope.md` may contain placeholder content.
- Fixture files exist at `.tmp/test-fixture-lNbOB4/` as discovered by the planner.

### After
- `scope.md` contains a draft code map listing the 3 fixture files and their roles.

### Acceptance criteria
- The code map in `scope.md` lists:
  - `/packages/orchestrator/.tmp/test-fixture-lNbOB4/package.json`
  - `/packages/orchestrator/.tmp/test-fixture-lNbOB4/scripts/build.js`
  - `/packages/orchestrator/.tmp/test-fixture-lNbOB4/scripts/verify.js`
- Each file is described with its role.

### Files to touch
- `scope.md`

### Test plan
- Open `scope.md` and confirm the three files are present with short descriptions.
