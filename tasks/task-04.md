## Task 04

### Goal
Create the full task queue: task-00.md through task-05.md, each with the required structure and self-contained work units.

### Before
- scope.md and rules.md exist as placeholders; fixture contents are readable.

### After
- Six task files exist under `tasks/` with complete Goals, Before/After, Acceptance Criteria, Files to Touch, and Test Plan.

### Acceptance criteria
- Files: `tasks/task-00.md` to `tasks/task-05.md` exist.
- Each file includes the required section headers.
- Each task is 15-60 minutes of work and self-contained.

### Files to touch
- `tasks/task-00.md`
- `tasks/task-01.md`
- `tasks/task-02.md`
- `tasks/task-03.md`
- `tasks/task-04.md`
- `tasks/task-05.md`

### Test plan
- Open each task file and verify the 6 required fields exist and are well-formed; ensure times are plausible.
